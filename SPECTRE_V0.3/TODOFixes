NEED FIXING

	Schematic:
		

	PCB:


	NICE TO HAVE
		Super cap connection for VBAT (for RTC backup sdcard logging)
		Separete 3.3 volt supply/chip (now 3.3 volt comes from ebay baord not very nice)
		Add Proto erea 
		Put status and indication leds on the outside. now not all visable when douther board is placed
		Add more ign output (8x) 
		Make boot0 a button no jumper
		Add reset button
		Internal SPI temperature/baro sensor (BME280)

FIXED for version 0.4

	Schematic:
		Fix 3.3v not connected for CLT sensor resistor
		Resistor between PE0 + PE1 and BAT54S to protect BAT54S from over current
		REsistor pulldown on PE0 + PE1 so no sync with floating input.
		Change fuel pump pin PA6 because PA6 is also LED used for visual feedback (PA4)	
		Change vbat pin because PC6 has not adc (change to PC5 for example)
		Flyback diode for both idle outputs (Diode To VBAT not special output)
		Flyback diode for FAN and Fuel output

	PCB:
		Fix headers on the side of the board serial + boot0 + boot1 (now shorting out with bottom plate)
		Plac VBAT measurements components on other header.
		Place bluetooth antenna outside of the PCB. 

	NICE TO HAVE
		Add boost control (with flyback diode)
		dc/dc converter for 5 volt now regulator getting hot (added to220 lm7805 can be dc dc version)
		Change injectors 1 to 4 to PWM output pins of same TIM for low-z injector driver (add inj 6..8 on TIM pwm) 
		Add more injector outputs (8x total)
