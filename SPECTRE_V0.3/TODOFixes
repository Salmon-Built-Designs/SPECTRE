SPECTRE	(Speeduino PrintEd Circuit TjeeRdiE)

NEED FIXING

Schematic:
Fix 3.3v not connected for CLT sensor resistor
Resistor between PE0 + PE1 and BAT54S to protect BAT54S from over current
Change fuel pump pin PA6 because PA6 is also LED used for visual feedback
Change vbat pin because PC6 has not adc (change to PC5 for example)
Flyback diode for both idle outputs (Diode To VBAT not special output)
Flyback diode for FAN and Fuel output

PCB:
Fix headers on the side of the board serial + boot0 + boot1 (now shorting out with bottom plate)

NICE TO HAVE
Add boost control (with flyback diode)
Super cap connection for VBAT (for RTC backup sdcard logging)
Separete 3.3 volt supply/chip (now 3.3 volt comes from ebay baord not very nice)
Add Proto erea 
dc/dc converter for 5 volt now regulator getting hot
Put status and indication leds on the outside. now not all visable when stm is placed
Change injectors 1 to 4 to PWM output pins of same TIM for low-z injector driver
Add more injector outputs (8x total) 
Add more ign output (8x) 
Make boot0 a button no jumper
Internal SPI temperature/baro sensor (BME280)
